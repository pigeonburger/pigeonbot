# PigeonBot

*A simple no-coding required Discord moderation bot with its own levels system!*

PigeonBot is designed to be self-hosted, meaning that you, as a server owner, run the bot yourself! Using PigeonBot requires no programming knowledge - all you have to do is edit a settings file, and PigeonBot will take care of the rest!

# Downloading and Installation

First, you'll have to let Discord know that you're going to host a bot yourself. To do this, follow parts 2 and 3 ***ONLY*** in [this article](https://www.wikihow.com/Create-a-Bot-in-Discord) (when creating the invite link for the bot, give the bot Administrator permissions).
